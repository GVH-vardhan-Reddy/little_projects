#Sequential defines a sequence of layers in the neural network.
#Flatten takes a square and turns it into a one-dimensional vector.
#Dense adds a layer of neurons.
#Activation functions tell each layer of neurons what to do. There are lots of options, but use these for now
#Relu effectively means that if X is greater than 0 return X, else return 0. It only passes values of 0 or greater to the next layer in the network.
'''Softmax takes a set of values, and effectively picks the biggest one. For example, 
if the output of the last layer looks like [0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1, 9.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05], 
then it saves you from having to sort for the largest valueâ€”it returns [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0].
